But still now is 4yrs she has not yet returned back every time I ask her why she have not returned as we agreed she will complained about different challenges she is going through over there. Early this year, she met a white man who promised to help her have a stay and better life on a condition of divorcing me and getting married to him. My wife sent me a divorce letter which I need to sign to prove we are no more married . She told me I should act along because through the White man she will have more opportunities over there and also have financial stability and be given a stay in UK.and she will be sending me money to support our 2 children. But if I didnt sign it she might be deported anytime She also warned me not to tell anyone including our families because she told me we should make it a secret. I am confused.
